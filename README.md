# PicoCTF Practice Problems<br>
#### **PREFACE:** I teach Computer Science and Cyber Security. PicoCTF is an amazing competition approach to teaching many skills in these fields; python, linux, cryptography, batch & bash scripts, etc... Many of the solutions here lean towards the simplest method, although not the fastest, as the target audience are beginning CS learners. Some challenges have scripts, others have walk-thru and some even have both! I also opt for creating simple functions in python over using modules because many students may not have access to downloading modules at their schhol site. Thus most of the time python 3 and the built-in modules should suffice. Enjoy. o.b

*All of these scripts assume you have downloaded the appropriate files from PicoCTF and placed in the same directory as the script. Some filenames were changed to reflect the challenge title.*

### NOTE TO SCRIPT KITTYS<br>
THEIR ARE NO PASSWORDS GIVEN FOR ANY CHALLENGES HERE. YOU MUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AT A MINIMUM. LEARN THE CODE. DO THE WORK.<br>
