# PicoCTF Challenge: Nice netcat...

There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: `$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342`, but it doesn't speak English...


### Hints:

1.  You can practice using netcat with this picoGym problem: _what's a netcat?_
2.  You can practice reading and writing ASCII with this picoGym problem: _Let's Warm Up_

## Solution:

_Connect to grab the ascii numbers_<br>
`$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342`

_Convert ASCII to string_
